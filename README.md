# Book_Lender

Book Lending App

___

Project Requirements:

To be able to use Nodes.js, MongoDB and Express to create CRUD for my books and users. Create at least two models and be able to Create, Update, Edit and Delete.

___

Deliverables:

A working app, hosted on heroku with a link you can access to view page, a working app in our Github repo
A Git repository hosted on Github, with no less than 30 commits.

___

MVP that was needed to complete the project:

A working create page that allows creating of a book
The ability for users to create, edit, and delete their info
The ability for users to be able to view all books
The ability to view all users

___

Technologies:

HTML
CSS
jQuery
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB.js

___

User stories:

As a user I want to keep track of the books I lend out. I want show all books/users, create new books/users, delete books/users and update books/users.

My Approach was to create ERDs, draw wireframes and create user stories so that I would have a solid game plan for project 2.

I created models, views, and routes. Full CRUD on both books and user, then deployed to Heroku upon completion.

___

My hangups with project 2:

I fell behind in getting the concept of how it all worked together but I was able to recover, learn by trial and error. I worked hard getting all the MVP's
done and I am proud to have a working app, with the exception that I didn't get to do the embedded part of it. I did add a button on the users page that redirects to takes you to books page.

My take away was that I built this app and it works but would like to continue added to it in the futre.
