Book Lending App

Project Requirements

The guidelines listed below were provided by the project markdown:

User of MongoDB and Express to create data CRUD Produce that expresses at least two models and are able to the Create, Update, Edit and Delete books and users.

Necessary Deliverables

A working app, hosted on the heroku with link, working app in our Github repo A Git repository hosted on Github, with no less than 30 commits.

MVP Some of the MVP that was needed to complete the project:

A working create page that allows to create a book
The ability for users to create, edit, and delete their info
The ability for users to be able to view books

Technologies:

HTML
CSS
jQuery
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB.js


User stories:

 As a user I want to keep track my book lending, show all books/users, create new books/users, delete books/users and udpdate books/users.

My Approach was to, create ERDs, draw wireframes and create user stories so that I could have a game plan for project 2.

I created models, views, and routes for this app. Full CRUD was needed and then deploy to Heroku upon completeion.

My hangups with project 2:

I fell behind in grasping the concept. I worked really worked hard and did my absoulute best to get all the MVP done. I am proud to have everything it all working, with the exception that didn't link the books and users in the same schema. But it's working.
